 *
 *   The privacy notice below is *accurate*: every item in `DATA_COLLECTED` was
 *   read out of the SQL in `supabase/` and the code that writes it, and
 *   `scripts/verify-about.ts` fails if the two drift apart. That part is worth
 *   having and is safe to show.
 *
 *   The terms are NOT a legal document. They describe how the service actually
 *   behaves, in plain English, which is a genuinely useful thing for a user to
 *   read — but they are not drafted by a lawyer, they create no enforceable
 *   position, and they are missing every clause that matters when something
 *   goes wrong. `TERMS_GAPS` lists what is absent.
 *
 *   Under the NDPR you are a data controller handling National Identification
 *   Numbers and bank account details. That is not a "get to it later" category
 *   of obligation. `LEGAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED` keeps the banner on screen until
 *   someone qualified has been through this.
