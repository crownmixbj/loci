 * Illustrations for the three "How LOCI Works" cards.
 *
 * Metro resolves bundled assets at build time, so these have to be static
 * `require`s — a runtime path string won't work. If an entry is ever set back
 * to null the card falls back to its lucide icon tile, so the layout holds
 * either way and nothing breaks in the meantime.
 *
 * These are the `-art` crops, not the originals. The supplied artwork has the
 * step number and title baked into a band across the top; that band is cropped
 * off here so the card can print the title as real text underneath, at a size
 * that stays legible when the image box is only 150dp tall. The uncropped
 * originals are still in `assets/images/` if the full composition is ever
 * wanted somewhere with more room.
