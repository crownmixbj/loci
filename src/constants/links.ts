/**
 * How a QR code on a desktop reaches the app on a phone.
 *
 * Two mechanisms, and the difference decides whether the standard cross-device
 * flow actually works:
 *
 *   custom scheme    `parcelmobile://capture/<id>`. Works when the app is
 *                    installed *and* the link is opened from somewhere that
 *                    honours arbitrary schemes. A phone's stock camera app
 *                    generally does not — it surfaces http(s) URLs and stays
 *                    silent on anything else. With no app installed it fails
 *                    with no message at all.
 *
 *   universal link   `https://<domain>/capture/<id>`. The stock camera offers
 *                    it because it is an ordinary web URL; the OS routes it to
 *                    the app when installed, and to the website when not. This
 *                    is what every cross-device identity flow uses, and it is
 *                    the only one where "point your phone camera at this" is a
 *                    true instruction.
 *
 * The domain is configuration, not a constant, because it does not exist until
 * someone owns it and hosts two association files at its root — see
 * `docs/DEEP-LINKS.md`. Until then the scheme is used and the UI says so
 * instead of promising the camera will work.
 */

/**
 * Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_LINK_DOMAIN` to the bare host, e.g. `loci.ng`.
 *
 * No protocol and no trailing slash: it is interpolated into both a URL and an
 * `applinks:` entry, and those want different shapes around the same host.
