/**
 * Driver guidelines and FAQs.
 *
 * Written from what this app and this business actually do — the review window
 * is `REVIEW_WORKING_DAYS`, the approval gate is the one in
 * `use-driver-eligibility`, the fare is what `estimateFee` quotes. Where the
 * app does not do something yet, the answer says so instead of describing a
 * feature that does not exist.
 *
 * Content lives here rather than in the screen so it can be checked against the
 * code by the verification script, and edited without touching layout.

  {
    key: 'how-long',
    question: 'How long does approval take?',
    answer:
      'Up to 7 working days from the day you submit. You can watch it move under Be a Driver / Updates. If you are past 7 working days, that screen says so and you should chase us.',
  },
  {
    key: 'browse-before',
    question: 'Can I see jobs before I am approved?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Find Open Jobs is open to everyone, and you can see the routes, weights and fares. The Accept button stays greyed out until an admin approves your application — browsing is not gated, claiming is.',
  },
  {
    key: 'notified',
    question: 'How will I know when I am approved?',
    answer:
      'The status on Be a Driver / Updates changes as soon as a reviewer records the decision, and if you have the app open you get a notification straight away. Decision emails are not switched on yet, so do not wait on your inbox for this one.',
  },
  {
    key: 'confirmation-email',
    question: 'I did not get the confirmation email.',
    answer:
      'Check your spam folder first. Be a Driver / Updates shows exactly whether that email was sent, failed, or was never attempted — so you can tell the difference rather than guessing. Your application is safe either way.',
  },
  {
    key: 'rejected',
    question: 'What happens if my application is rejected?',
    answer:
      'You will see the outcome, and the reviewer’s note if they left one, under Be a Driver / Updates. One live application is allowed per account, so re-applying means the old record has to be cleared first — contact support.',
  },
  {
    key: 'paid',
    question: 'When and how do I get paid?',
    answer:
      'Payouts go to the bank account on your application. The figure on a job is the fare quoted to the sender, and the Driver Portal shows it as expected payout, not as money already earned — there is no payout ledger in the app yet, so treat those figures as what a job is worth rather than a balance.',
  },
  {
    key: 'edit-details',
    question: 'How do I change my vehicle or phone number?',
    answer:
      'Not from the app. Those details were verified during review, so changing them has to go back through a person — email support. A plate that does not match the one on your application will be turned away at a hub.',
  },
  {
    key: 'multiple',
    question: 'Can I carry more than one job at a time?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Anything you have claimed appears under Your deliveries in the Driver Portal, split into in progress and delivered. Only claim what you can actually complete inside each job’s window.',
  },
  {
    key: 'documents',
    question: 'Who can see the documents I uploaded?',
    answer:
      'You and LOCI reviewers, nobody else. They are held in a private store and opened through short-lived links, so a URL that leaks does not stay usable. Other drivers cannot see them.',
  },
  {
    key: 'stop',
    question: 'Can I stop driving?',
    answer:
      'Yes, at any time — there is no minimum. Finish or hand back anything you have already accepted first, so no sender is left without a carrier.',
