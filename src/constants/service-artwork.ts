/**
 * Full-bleed artwork for the four service cards on the home screen.
 *
 * These are the `-tile` renders of the supplied designs: trimmed to each one's
 * own panel so the app card *is* the panel rather than a card inside a card,
 * recoloured onto the same warm paper the "How LOCI Works" artwork uses
 * (246,245,239 — measured, not guessed), and padded to a taller shared aspect.
 *
 * The recolour is a per-channel gain that maps each design's own paper onto the
 * target, so the line art keeps its saturation. Alpha-keying the white was
 * tried first and left every illustration visibly faded.
 *
 * Each image carries its own title — "Hub-to-Hub standard", "Public Location
 * Pickup and Delivery", "Intra & Inter-State", "Bulk & Heavy Goods" — so the
 * card renders no text of its own. Those baked-in titles do NOT match the card
 * titles in `CATEGORIES`; the copy there now survives only as the
 * accessibility label, since text inside an image is invisible to a screen
 * reader. Untouched originals remain in `assets/images/`.
