 * Edit Profile — the driver's own details, grouped by what a mistake costs.

 * The structure is the argument. `supabase/29_driver_profile_edits.sql` sorts
 * every field into low, high or locked, and a driver who cannot see which is
 * which will eventually change their legal name to fix a typo and find
 * themselves suspended mid-shift. So the form has three tiers, visually
 * distinct, and the expensive one states its price before it will open.
 *
 * ⚠ Within the editable tier the grouping is by *subject* — vehicle, personal,
 *   next of kin — not by risk, because every field in it carries the same
 *   (zero) consequence and sorting them by consequence would be sorting them by
 *   a distinction that does not apply. Risk separates the tiers; subject
