 *   icon-only links  671px   the same links as 34px circles

 *
 * Measured against the *widest* role variant — "My Parcels" is 21px longer than
 * "My Jobs", so sizing to the driver label would overflow for senders.
 *
 * These move whenever a link is added. Adding "My Jobs" pushed the labelled row
 * from 877px to 997px, which silently invalidated the previous 900 breakpoint
 * and would have put the avatar back on the capsule's rounded edge between 900
 * and 997. Re-measure after any change to `NAV_LINKS`.
 *
 * The Hubs caret is the most recent change: a 15px chevron plus its padding and
 * the row gap costs 19px, which against the recorded 997px left only 4px of
 * slack under the old 1020 threshold. Both labelled tiers moved up 20px to put
 * the headroom back — 4px is not a margin, it is a rounding error waiting to

 * One entry in the capsule: a link, or a menu that holds several.

 * pointing at its own `href`, and every one of those four hrefs was the same
 * destination as the entry's *first child*: Jobs & Drivers → Find Open Jobs,
 * Shipments → Send a New Parcel, Hubs → Drop-off / Pickup Locations, About Us →
 * About LOCI. So clicking a heading looked exactly like the app choosing item
 * one for you, which is what it was doing.
 *
 * That also collapses the caret into the label. Two controls made sense while
 * the heading led somewhere of its own; now it is one thing — a disclosure —
 * and splitting it would leave a second tab stop that does the same job.
 *
 * The menu is deliberately not hover-only. Hover does not exist on a phone, and
 * a menu that only opens on hover is unreachable by touch, keyboard or screen
 * reader — so hover is a web accelerator and the press is the real control.
