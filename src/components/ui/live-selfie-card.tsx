/**
 * The live photo, taken on the last page of a form rather than after it.
 *
 * ⚠ This used to run *after* the submit button.
 *
 *   Both long forms ended the same way: press Post parcel / Submit application,
 *   and a sheet none of the copy had mentioned asked for a photograph of your
 *   face. Three things were wrong with that. It is a surprise at the one moment
 *   somebody believes they have finished; a face is sensitive data under the
 *   NDPA and asking for it inside a submit handler gives no chance to stop and
 *   read why; and a failure there — a refused camera, a liveness check that
 *   cannot reach its provider — arrived as an error on an action the person
 *   thought had already succeeded.
 *
 *   Here it is an item on the page with the other required items, above the
 *   confirmation checkbox, and the form knows whether it has been done before
 *   the button is ever pressed.
 *
 * ⚠ Camera only, never the gallery.
 *
 *   The whole value of the photo is that it was taken now, by the person
 *   holding the device. `SenderPhotoSheet` reaches the camera through
 *   `launchCameraAsync` on native and `getUserMedia` on web — neither can
 *   return a file already on the device, and `launchImageLibraryAsync` must not
 *   appear anywhere on this path. `verify-liveness-integration` asserts it.
 *
 * The upload and the liveness check both happen here, on capture, so a photo
 * that will be rejected is rejected while the form is still on screen and
 * editable. What the caller gets back is a capture session id, ready to be
 * spent on the parcel or the application.
