/**
 * A screen whose own header stays put while its body scrolls under it.
 *
 * Distinct from `StickyHeaderScreen` above, which mounts the *web* chrome — the
 * brand capsule and ticker — and renders nothing at all on a phone. This is for
 * a screen's own header: the driver's avatar, name, city and notification bell,
 * the block that should never leave the top of a phone screen.
 *
 * ⚠ The arrangement is the whole implementation, and it is not decoration.
 *
 *   React Native has no `position: sticky`. The only way to keep a block still
 *   while content moves under it is to make it a *sibling* of the scroll
 *   container rather than its first child, inside a column flex parent that
 *   fills the screen. The scroller then takes `flex: 1` — the remaining space —
 *   and clips its own content instead of pushing the header up and away.
 *
 *   Get any one of those three wrong and it still renders: the header simply
 *   scrolls off, which looks like a design choice rather than a bug.
 *
 * ⚠ No safe-area inset here. The `(tabs)` layout reserves the status bar once
 *   for every screen inside it, and `verify-layout` asserts nothing reserves it
 *   twice — a second inset would push this header down by the height of the
 *   notch.
 *
 * `children` must do its own scrolling. That is the point.
