/**
 * The three things a sender uploads, for the admin drawer.
 *
 * ⚠ Three uploads, two rules, and the split is the point.
 *
 *   The parcel is shown outright. It is a box on a table: it answers "what
 *   condition was this in when it was handed over", which is the same kind of
 *   question as its weight, and staff should not have to justify looking at it.
 *
 *   The selfie and the NIN slip are hidden until somebody asks and says why.
 *   One is a face and the other a government identity document — both sensitive
 *   personal data under the NDPA, and the sender was told the photo is "stored
 *   privately, visible only to you and to LOCI staff". The reveal writes a line
 *   naming who looked before it hands anything back, the same door
 *   `admin_reveal_parcel_contacts` puts in front of a phone number.
 *
 *   ⚠ Both come through *one* reveal, not one each.
 *
 *     The question they answer — is the person in this photo the person on this
 *     document — is a single act of looking. Two reveals would mean two reason
 *     boxes and two log lines for it, and a reason box filled in twice to answer
 *     one question is a reason box people stop reading.
 *
 *   Making all three free would be careless. Making all three cost a reason
 *   would be worse than either: an operator typing "checking" six times a day to
 *   see a cardboard box produces an audit trail that proves nothing.
