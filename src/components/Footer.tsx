   *   the base of the page. Defaulting to `true` makes the common case correct
   *   without anyone having to think about it.
   *
   *   The home page is the exception. Its padding lives on an inner `page` view
   *   and the footer is already outside it, so cancelling gutters that are not
   *   there would push the footer wider than the window and put a horizontal
   *   scrollbar on the marketing page.

   *
   *   Deciding it inside the component is what keeps the rule true: a screen
