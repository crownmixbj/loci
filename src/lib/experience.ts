 * The whole rule lives in `resolveExperience` below, as a pure function of four

 *   matters — claiming a job, reading an application, writing a hub — is a Row
 *   Level Security policy or a `security definer` function, and stays that way.
 *   This decides what is *shown*, which is a usability question.
