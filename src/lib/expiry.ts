/**
 * Expiry dates: parsing what a driver types, and saying what it means.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from any component, because these are the rules a driver's
 * ability to earn now depends on — an expired licence stops dispatch — and they
 * should be testable without a screen, a clock or a database.
 *
 * ⚠ Typed, not picked, and that is deliberate.
 *
 *   `DeparturePicker` offers the next fourteen days because a journey departs
 *   soon. A licence expires in 2029. Scrolling a wheel from today to a date
 *   four years out is worse than typing eight digits, and the driver is holding
 *   the document with the date printed on it while they do it.
 *
 * ⚠ Day-first, because Nigeria writes dates day-first.
 *
 *   `03/04/2029` is 3 April here and 4 March in an American reading. Getting
 *   this backwards would not error — it would silently store a date up to
 *   eleven months wrong, fire reminders on the wrong day, and block a driver
 *   whose licence is perfectly valid. So the input is masked to DD/MM/YYYY and
 *   the parsed result is echoed back in an unambiguous long form ("3 April
 *   2029") for the driver to check against the card in their hand.
