/**
 * Reading a local file so Supabase Storage will accept it.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS EXISTS BECAUSE THE SAME BUG WAS WRITTEN THREE TIMES.
 *
 *   Every upload in this app started as `fetch(uri).blob()`, and that one line
 *   fails in two different ways on a real Android phone:
 *
 *     1. `Response.prototype.blob` is sometimes undefined. React Native's fetch
 *        is `whatwg-fetch`, which only defines `blob()` if `Blob` and
 *        `FileReader` are globals when the polyfill loads — they are installed
 *        lazily by `setUpXHR`, so it depends on module evaluation order.
 *        Hermes reports the result as "undefined is not a function", which is
 *        what the delivery proof upload showed.
 *
 *     2. When it *does* work, `blob.type` is whatever RN's file handler put in
 *        the response header, and for a `file://` read that is regularly
 *        `text/plain`. Passing it through as the content type gets the object
 *        rejected by a bucket that allows images:
 *
 *            mime type text/plain is not supported
 *
 *        which is what the sender's verification photo showed. The photo was
 *        fine; the label on it was not.
 *
 *   `XMLHttpRequest` with `responseType = 'arraybuffer'` is React Native core.
 *   It decodes natively and touches neither Blob nor FileReader, and the
 *   content type comes from the file *name*, which is the thing that actually
 *   knows what the file is.
 *
 * Fixing one caller and not the others is how this got written three times, so
 * every upload in the app now goes through here.

/**
 * Reads a local file as bytes.

 * `contentTypeHint` wins when the caller genuinely knows better — a document
 * picker reports the type the OS assigned, which beats guessing from an
 * extension the user may have typed.
 *
 * ⚠ The file system first, the network stack only as a fallback.
 *
 *   `readFileBytes` used to be XHR alone, and a driver taking their selfie on a
 *   real phone got "Could not read that file off this device." — which is this
 *   file's own words for `XMLHttpRequest.onerror`.
 *
 *   The reason is that XHR is a *network* client being asked to open a local
 *   path. On Android it is backed by OkHttp, which speaks http and https and
 *   nothing else; whether a `file://` read works at all depends on which
 *   request handlers happen to be registered, and `content://` — what the OS
 *   hands back for anything reached through the storage framework — it cannot
 *   open under any circumstances. The photo was on the device the whole time.
 *
 *   `expo-file-system` reads through the platform's own file APIs, so the
 *   scheme is its problem rather than ours. It is not a new dependency: `expo`
 *   depends on it directly, so it is already linked into every build this app
 *   has ever produced.
 *
 *   XHR stays for the web, where the two things a browser hands back — a
 *   `blob:` URL from the camera element and a `data:` URL — are exactly what it
 *   is good at, and what the file system module has no view of.
