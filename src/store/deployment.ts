/**
 * Whether the thing you are looking at is the thing that was built.
 *
 * ⚠ This exists because the same misunderstanding has cost three rounds.
 *
 *   A fix ships, the person testing it opens the app, the old behaviour is
 *   still there, and it is reported as still broken. Every time, the code was
 *   right and one of two things was stale: the bundle on the device, or the
 *   schema in the database. Nothing on screen could tell them apart, so the
 *   only way to find out was another round trip.
 *
 *   There is no EAS Update on this project, so a JS change needs a new binary;
 *   the web build is deployed separately again; and migrations are run by hand.
 *   Three clocks, none of them visible.
 *
 * ⚠ The database half is read from PostgREST's own OpenAPI document, not by
 *   calling the functions.
 *
 *   Calling `admin_reveal_sender_identity` to see whether it exists would write
 *   an audit line saying an administrator looked at somebody's face. A probe
 *   with a side effect is not a probe. The root of `/rest/v1/` lists every
 *   exposed function and changes nothing.
