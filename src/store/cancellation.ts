 * This is the client's copy of it, used only to decide whether to *show* a
 * button. Every attempt is re-checked on the server, so a modified client gains
 * nothing but a button that returns an error.
 *
 * Two windows, both closing at the moment somebody else's effort is committed:
 *
 *   sender  while the parcel is still 'Booked'. Once a driver claims it,
 *           someone may already be riding towards the pickup.
 *   driver  while the parcel is still 'Assigned'. Once it is 'Picked Up' the
 *           driver is holding someone else's property, and there is no flow in
 *           this app for handing it back.
