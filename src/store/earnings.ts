/**
 * What a driver has earned, and what they are still owed for work in progress.
 *
 * ⚠ "Expected", never "earned", and the distinction is the whole reason this
 *   file is careful.
 *
 *   Every figure here is the *quoted fare* on a parcel — what the sender was
 *   charged, gross. It is not a balance, and it is not what this driver will be
 *   paid.
 *
 * ⚠ There is now a ledger, and that made this file *more* dangerous rather than
 *   less.
 *
 *   `supabase/30_driver_wallet.sql` credits `driver_earnings` on delivery, net
 *   of the commission rate recorded on the row, and `driver_balance` subtracts
 *   a security hold and any open payout. So the wallet and this module will
 *   routinely disagree, in three compounding ways at once:
 *
 *     · this counts parcels still moving; the ledger credits only on delivery
 *     · this is gross; the ledger is net of commission
 *     · the ledger holds new money for a day, and subtracts open requests
 *
 *   A driver seeing "Expected ₦12,000" here and "Available ₦0" in the wallet
 *   has not found a bug, but they have found a contradiction — and being told
 *   two different numbers about your own money is worse than being told one
 *   vague one. Every screen showing this total therefore names it as a quote
 *   *and* points at the wallet as the figure that counts. Neither half alone is
 *   enough.

 *   that did not happen. `isFinished` covers Delivered and Cancelled together,
 *   so the delivered side checks the status explicitly rather than reusing it.

 * enforces server-side. A row for somebody else's parcel could not be read in
