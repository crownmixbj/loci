/**
 * The two photographs a parcel carries, and who may look at them.
 *
 * ⚠ They are not the same kind of thing, and this file keeps them apart.
 *
 *   The parcel photo is a box on a table. It answers an operational question —
 *   what condition was this in when it was handed over — and staff read it the
 *   way they read a weight or an address.
 *
 *   The sender photo is a human face: sensitive personal data under the NDPA,
 *   and the sender is told it is "stored privately, visible only to you and to
 *   LOCI staff". Reaching it — and the NIN slip beside it — goes through
 *   `admin_reveal_sender_identity`, which writes a line naming who looked in the
 *   same transaction that returns the paths. Same shape as the contact reveal in
 *   `17_admin_parcel_detail.sql`.
 *
 *   Putting the parcel behind the reveal too would be worse, not safer: staff
 *   would type something into a reason box several times a day to see a
 *   cardboard box, and an audit trail full of "checking" is not evidence of
 *   anything.
