 * invitation to push the date out rather than renew the card.
 *
 * It unlocks in three situations, and each one is a real need rather than a
 * convenience:
 *
 *   · no date has ever been recorded — every document that predates
 *     `31_document_expiry.sql` is in this state, because the backfill could not
 *     invent dates. Without this the reminder ladder can never start for any
 *     existing driver, and the dispatch block never covers them.
 *
 *   · the document has expired — the case the lock exists to allow.
 *
 *   · the document is inside its renewal window.
 *
 * ⚠ THE THIRD ONE IS A DELIBERATE WIDENING OF THE BRIEF, and it should be easy
 *   to reverse: delete `state === 'expiring'` below.
 *
 *   "Not editable until it has expired" read strictly means a driver who
 *   renews their licence three weeks early cannot tell LOCI until the old one
 *   lapses — so dispatch stops, they lose at least a day's work, and they lose
 *   it for having been organised. That directly contradicts what the reminder
 *   says to them ("renew before the date and nothing changes"), and the warning
 *   window is precisely when renewal happens.
 *
 *   The concern the lock addresses — a driver quietly extending a date on a
 *   valid document — is untouched by this: outside the window it is still
 *   read-only, and the server refuses any date in the past regardless.
