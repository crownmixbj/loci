/**
 * Schedule My Journey — where a driver declares what they are doing.
 *
 * This screen used to be two things: the journey planner, and below it an open
 * marketplace of unmatched parcels with an Accept Order button on each. The
 * board is gone, and its absence is the feature.
 *
 * ⚠ Why browsing was removed rather than kept as a fallback.
 *
 *   The two ways of getting work were not equal and could not co-exist quietly.
 *   An offer is exclusive for its window — one live offer per parcel is a unique
 *   index — while the board was first-come. So a parcel could be held for a
 *   driver who was reading its countdown and simultaneously claimed out from
 *   under them by somebody scrolling a list. The offer's guarantee was only ever
 *   true if nobody used the board.
 *
 *   It also made the two modes indistinguishable in practice. Flash exists so a
 *   driver sitting in one city gets local parcels pushed to them; a board that
 *   listed those same parcels made Flash an opt-in nicety on top of a
 *   marketplace rather than the mechanism.
 *
 * ⚠ And what that cost, which is real.
 *
 *   The board was the only thing that still moved parcels when dispatch broke,
 *   and dispatch has broken twice. The replacement is `admin_assign_parcel`
 *   (25_dispatch_only.sql) — one audited human path, held by an admin, rather
 *   than an open list every driver can work around the matcher with.
 *
 * Nothing here fetches parcels any more. A driver's work reaches them on
 * Assigned Trip, as a timed offer, or not at all.

      Every other route — book, tracking, locations, support, driver-signup,

      This screen did too until I rewrote it to strip the marketplace board and
      did not carry the constraint across, so on a desktop the form stretched
      the full viewport: a "To" dropdown a thousand pixels wide, and a caveat
      line nobody can track back to its own left margin.

      A form field wider than about 800px is not a style preference. Line length
      and target size are the two things every desktop form convention agrees
      on, and an input that spans the window fails both.
