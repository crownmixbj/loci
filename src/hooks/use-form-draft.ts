/**
 * Keeps a long form's answers across navigation, reloads and sign-in.
 *
 * The driver application and the booking form both ask for an account at
 * *submit* rather than on entry, which is the right order — nobody should have
 * to sign in before seeing whether the thing is worth filling in. But it means
 * the app navigates away mid-form, and `useState` does not survive that:
 * `router.replace('/driver-signup')` after sign-in mounts a *new* screen, and
 * signing up leaves the app entirely for an email confirmation.
 *
 * So the answers live somewhere that outlives the component.
 *
 * ⚠ These drafts contain personal data — a NIN, a bank account number, a
 *   guarantor's details. Three mitigations, all deliberate:
 *
 *     1. They expire (`TTL_MS`), so an abandoned draft doesn't sit on a device
 *        indefinitely.
 *     2. They are cleared on successful submit — the server has it now.
 *     3. They are cleared on sign-out, which is the "I'm done on this shared
 *        computer" signal.
 *
 *   On web this is `localStorage`, readable by any script on the origin. That
 *   is the same place the session token lives, so it is not a new class of
 *   exposure — but if you ever decide a half-finished application is too
 *   sensitive to keep locally, `DRAFT_KEYS` below is the list to stop writing.
