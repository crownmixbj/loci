/**
 * Assertions for push notifications and the unified matcher.
 *
 * The risks here are quiet ones again:
 *
 *   - A push token is a bearer credential. Anyone holding one can notify that
 *     device with no key of their own.
 *   - A notification renders on a lock screen — the least private surface in the
 *     system — so anything in the body is public to whoever is stood nearby.
 *   - A dead token never stops being dead, and keeping it makes "we notified
 *     them" true in the log and false in the world.
