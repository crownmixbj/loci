/**
 * Assertions for document expiry and the dispatch mode switch.
 *
 * `scripts/pg/documents-harness.mjs` executes both migrations and proves the
 * behaviour. This file covers what execution cannot see:
 *
 *   · that the client's copy of the document policy agrees with the SQL,
 *     field for field — they are two hand-maintained lists and the failure
 *     mode of a disagreement is silent
 *   · that a date typed day-first is read day-first
 *   · that the surfaces say what the rules cost
 *
 * The first of those is the one that matters most. A driver's ability to earn
 * now depends on a key matching between a TypeScript array and a Postgres
 * table, and nothing in either language checks the other.
