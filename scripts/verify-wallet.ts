/**
 * Assertions for the driver wallet.
 *
 * The ledger itself is proven by execution — `scripts/pg/wallet-harness.mjs`
 * runs the migration in PGlite and checks the arithmetic against real Postgres.
 * This file covers the part a harness cannot see: whether the screen a driver
 * actually opens tells them the truth about the money, and whether they can get
 * to it at all.
 *
 * Three of these exist because of mistakes already made on this project:
 * a screen added to the web dropdown and left unreachable on the phone
 * (`/available-packages` and the offer card), a caveat asserted by pinning a
 * string that a rename walks straight past, and a route added without a
 * `ROUTE_EXPERIENCES` line quietly appearing in the sender app.
