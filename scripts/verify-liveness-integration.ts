/**
 * Assertions for the Dojah liveness integration.
 *
 * Three things carry real risk here, and everything below guards one of them:
 *
 *   1. The secret key. Anything reachable from the client bundle is readable by
 *      anyone who installs the app, and a leaked Dojah key spends LOCI's wallet.
 *   2. The sandbox/production distinction. Dojah's own docs: "Never use mock
 *      data to make a live trust decision." A sandbox pass rendered like a real
 *      one is exactly that mistake.
 *   3. The difference between "not a live person" and "the provider is down".
 *      Confusing them turns a Dojah outage into every sender in Nigeria being
 *      accused of fraud and unable to post a parcel.
