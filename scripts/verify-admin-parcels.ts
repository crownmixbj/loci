/**
 * Assertions for admin parcel access.
 *
 * The whole risk here is a privacy one, and it is quiet. Nobody notices an
 * admin dashboard that hands out every customer's home address — it just works,
 * and works a bit too well. So the assertions guard the boundary rather than
 * the behaviour:
 *
 *   - no broad admin read policy on `bookings`, ever
 *   - the detail function returns no contact column
 *   - every reveal is logged before the data is returned
 *   - the open board is no longer readable by any signed-in account
