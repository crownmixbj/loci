 *   2. `src/store/driver-documents.ts` does the same for driver paperwork.
 *   3. Each bucket's `allowed_mime_types`, in SQL, decides what is *accepted*.
 *
 *   When they disagree the failure is silent until a real person has already
 *   taken the photo: the read works, the label is honest, the request is built,
 *   and Storage answers "mime type X is not supported". That has now happened
 *   twice — `text/plain` for a mislabelled JPEG, and `image/heif`, which every
 *   client map has always known and no bucket allowed.
 *
 *   Both are parsed here rather than transcribed, so this cannot pass by the
 *   same wrong thing being written in two places.
