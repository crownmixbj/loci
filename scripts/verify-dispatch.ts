/**
 * Assertions for automated dispatch.
 *
 * The failure modes worth guarding are the ones that lose a parcel rather than
 * the ones that throw:
 *
 *   - Two drivers told the same parcel is theirs.
 *   - A parcel held by an offer nobody will ever answer.
 *   - A declined offer rotating straight back to the driver who declined it.
 *   - A driver able to offer themselves any parcel in the country.
 *
 * None of those produces an error. Each produces an app that looks like it is
 * working while parcels quietly stop moving.
