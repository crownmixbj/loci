/**
 * Assertions for the two multi-step forms.
 *
 * A wizard has one failure mode that a single-page form cannot have: a field
 * that belongs to no step. It renders nowhere, so it can never be filled in;
 * `validate` still refuses it, so Submit fails; and because the message is
 * scoped to a step nobody can reach, the button appears to do nothing at all.
 * That is unfindable from the outside and trivially detectable from here.
 *
 * So the centrepiece is a partition check — every field on exactly one step,
 * derived from both files rather than transcribed. Everything else guards the
 * navigation around it.
