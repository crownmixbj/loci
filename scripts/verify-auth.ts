/**
 * Assertions for what happens when somebody clicks a confirmation link.
 *
 * ⚠ Every branch here is awkward to reach by hand, which is exactly why they
 *   are worth pinning.
 *
 *   Reproducing an expired token means waiting an hour. Reproducing the
 *   wrong-account case means two accounts, two mailboxes and a shared browser.
 *   Nobody does that twice, so these paths get written once, tested once and
 *   then quietly rot — while being the paths that decide whether an account
 *   ends up confirmed against the wrong person.
 *
 * The rules are imported and run, not transcribed.
