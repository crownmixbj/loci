 *   every direction change, and every one of those frames reflowed the screen
 *   below it. On the driver application, the largest tree in the app, that read
 *   as stutter: a header that bought 140px by making the scrolling it bought
 *   them for worse.
 *
 *   The two halves could not be separated. Reclaiming the space *is* the layout
 *   work; a compositor-only transform moves the pixels and leaves the box, so
 *   the header disappears and the space stays spent on an empty band. Between a
 *   smooth scroll and 140px, the scroll wins — it is felt on every screen, all
 *   the time, by everybody.
