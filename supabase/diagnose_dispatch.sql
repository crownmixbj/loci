-- LOCI — why is no parcel being offered right now?

-- Read-only. Changes nothing. Safe to run on production, any number of times.
--
-- Paste into the Supabase SQL editor and run ONE BLOCK AT A TIME — the editor
-- only shows the result of the last statement, so running the whole file at once
-- hides everything except block D.
--
-- Read them in order. Block B is the one that answers the question.
