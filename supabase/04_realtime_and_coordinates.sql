-- ------------------------------------------------------------- realtime ----

/*
  Realtime broadcasts row changes over a websocket. Two things matter here:

  1. The table must be in the `supabase_realtime` publication, or no events are
     emitted at all.
  2. `replica identity full` makes Postgres include the *old* row in the change
     payload. Without it the client receives only the new values and cannot tell
     `pending -> approved` from `approved -> approved`, so it would toast on
     every unrelated edit.

  RLS still applies to realtime: a subscriber only receives rows they could have
  read with a select. An applicant therefore cannot listen to anyone else's
  application, even by removing the client-side filter.

  Where the parcel is actually collected and delivered.

  Nullable because every parcel posted before this column existed has no pin,
  and because a sender may skip the map. The UI falls back to the text address,
  which is what it did before — a missing pin is a missing pin, not a broken
  screen.

  Stored as two numerics rather than PostGIS geography: the app only needs to
  drop markers and draw a straight line, and adding an extension for that would
  be weight without benefit. Revisit if you ever need "jobs within 5km of me".
