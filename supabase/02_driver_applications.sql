--   the NDPR that makes you a data controller with real obligations. Two things
--   follow, and neither is optional before real applicants use this:
--
--     1. Access is restricted below to the applicant and to admins. Nobody else,
--        including other drivers, can read a row.
--     2. You should decide how long you keep rejected applications, and delete
--        them on that schedule. There is no retention policy here because that
--        is a business decision, not a technical one.

  deliberately NOT settable by any client: no policy below grants update on it,
  which means only the service role — the Supabase dashboard, or a server you
  control — can promote someone. If a user could set this column, the admin
  dashboard would be self-service.

  The role check is the whole point. A BEFORE UPDATE trigger fires for *every*

  app, leaving no way to create the first admin.

  PostgREST connects as `authenticator` and then does `SET LOCAL ROLE` to
  `authenticated` or `anon` for each request, so `current_user` is one of those
  for anything coming from the app. The SQL editor runs as `postgres`, which
  falls through and is allowed.

  Deliberately NOT `security definer`: that would make `current_user` the
  function's owner (postgres) for every caller, and the check would never fire.
