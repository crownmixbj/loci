-- LOCI — a parcel stops being dispatchable after the first missed offer.
--
-- Run after 01–19. Re-runnable. Safe to run on a database that is already stuck.
--
-- ⚠ THIS IS A BUG FIX, AND THE BUG WAS MINE.
--
-- Two places disagreed about what "live offer" means:
--
--   dispatch_offers_one_live_per_booking   where status = 'offered'
--   dispatch_booking's guard               status = 'offered' and expires_at > now()
--
-- A partial index cannot call `now()` — it is not immutable — so the index has
-- no time component. That is fine only while something promptly moves lapsed
-- offers to 'expired'. Nothing did: `expire_dispatch_offers()` was written to be
-- run on a schedule and the schedule was left as a line in a comment.
--
-- So the moment an offer lapsed unanswered:
--
--   * dispatch_booking's guard let it through — the offer had expired
--   * the INSERT then hit the unique index, which still saw status='offered'
--   * the whole function raised, and the parcel was never offered again
--
-- The parcel sits on the open board looking normal. Nothing errors anywhere a
-- person would see. It simply stops being assigned, forever.
--
-- Three fixes: expire lazily so dispatch heals itself, tell a decline apart from
-- a lapse so a one-driver city still works, and actually schedule the sweep.

-- --------------------------------- 1. a lapse is not a refusal ------------

/*
  The old index refused a second offer to a driver on any grounds at all:

      unique (booking_id, driver_id)

  That is right for a decline — they said no, and rotating back is how a driver
  learns to ignore dispatch. It is wrong for an expiry, which means they never
  saw it: there is no push notification yet, so an unanswered offer is the
  *normal* outcome, not a refusal.

  With one approved driver the old rule retired a parcel permanently after the
  first miss. Which is exactly the state this database is in.

/**
 * Offers a parcel to the best available journey.
 *
 * Replaces the version in 18_flash_mode.sql. Three changes, all about not
 * getting stuck:
 *
 *   1. Lapsed offers on this parcel are settled *first*, so the index and the
 *      guard can no longer disagree.
 *   2. A driver who let an offer lapse is tried again, but only after every
 *      driver who has never seen the parcel — the queue still moves outward
 *      before it comes back round.
 *   3. The insert cannot raise. A losing race returns null instead of aborting
 *      the caller, which for the insert trigger means a parcel still gets
 *      posted even if dispatch has a bad moment.

      `service_key` in `private.app_settings` and a deploy before any of it
      leaves the database.
    - A driver who never opens the app still collects and lapses offers in
      rotation. Nothing yet notices a driver who is nominally available and
      never responds.
