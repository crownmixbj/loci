-- LOCI — automated dispatch.
--
-- Run after 01–14. Re-runnable.
--
-- Replaces "drivers browse a board and claim what they like" with "drivers
-- declare the journeys they are making, and parcels are offered to them".
--
-- ⚠ THIS CHANGES THE DEAL WITH DRIVERS. The About page said "Drivers pick the
--   jobs they want. No forced dispatch", and How It Works said "Claimed, not
--   auto-assigned". Both are edited in the same change as this file, because
--   shipping the mechanism while leaving the promise standing would be telling
--   drivers something untrue on a page they can read.
--
-- The design is an *offer*, not an assignment:
--
--   A parcel is offered to one driver at a time and held for them for a few
--   minutes. They accept, decline, or let it lapse; then it moves to the next
--   best journey. Nobody is committed to a parcel they have not looked at, and
--   nobody has to sit refreshing a list.
--
-- The alternative — assigning outright — was rejected because a driver who
-- declared "Ibadan to Lagos on Tuesday" has told us their route, not agreed in
-- advance to whatever turns up on it.
