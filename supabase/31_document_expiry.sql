  31_document_expiry.sql — documents that go out of date, and what that costs.

  Until now a driver's documents were a jsonb blob on the application:

      documents = {"licence": "u1/licence.jpg", "insurance": "u1/insurance.pdf"}

  A path and nothing else. No expiry, no verification state, no history of
  replacement. That was adequate while the only question was "did they attach
  one", and it stops being adequate the moment the answer has to be "is it still
  valid" — a key/value map has nowhere to put a date, and bolting one on as
  `{"licence": {"path": ..., "expires": ...}}` makes every existing reader wrong
  at once with no type to catch it.

  So documents become rows. The jsonb stays where it is and is backfilled from,
  not deleted: an application submitted last year is the evidence a reviewer
  approved, and rewriting it to fit a new shape would edit the record of a
  decision somebody already made.

  ⚠ THE ONE CONSEQUENTIAL DECISION IN THIS FILE

    An expired *licence or insurance* stops a driver being offered parcels.
    Chosen deliberately over warn-only: the alternative is LOCI knowingly
    dispatching an uninsured rider, and "we sent them a reminder" is not a
    defence anyone would want to make after a crash.

    It is also the decision most likely to hurt somebody. A driver who does not
    open the app for a fortnight can find themselves silently unable to earn.
    Everything below is shaped by that risk rather than in spite of it:

      · reminders start 30 days out, not on the day
      · they escalate, and they repeat daily *after* expiry rather than stopping
      · the driver is told the specific document and the specific date
      · the block is stated on their own screens, not left to be inferred from
        an absence of offers
      · `dispatch_blockers()` exists so the reason is always retrievable

    A block whose reason a driver cannot see is indistinguishable from the app
    being broken, and they will conclude the second thing.

  Requires: 02_driver_applications.sql, 07_admin.sql, 26_departure_time.sql.

    False for slots that do not meaningfully expire. Asking for a date on a

    fiction.

  ⚠ Three of the five slots carry no expiry date at all, and the government ID
    slots are the ones worth explaining.

    They accept a NIN slip, a National ID card or a Voter's Card — none of which
    expires — and a NIN is what almost everybody uploads. An optional date field
    on a document with no date printed on it does not produce an empty field; it
    produces a date somebody invented, and the reminder ladder then runs on
    fiction and chases a driver about a document that cannot lapse.

    The cost is real and small: a driver who uploads an International Passport
    into that slot loses expiry tracking on it. That slot never blocks dispatch,
    so nothing stops working — the loss is a reminder LOCI would have sent about
    a document it does not gate on. Cheaper than the alternative, which is a
    field five drivers in six should leave blank and will not.

  ⚠ The key is `license`, US spelling, and the label is `licence`, British.

    That looks like a mistake and is not. The key must match what
    `src/app/(tabs)/driver-signup.tsx` has been writing into the `documents`
    jsonb and into the storage path `<uid>/license.jpg` since the form shipped.
    Spelling it `licence` here would leave the backfill matching nothing, every
    existing licence unmodelled, and — because a document that does not exist
    cannot be expired — the dispatch block silently inert for the one document
    it most needs to cover.

    The label is what a Nigerian driver reads, so that stays British. Renaming
    the key is a data migration, not a spelling fix, and is not worth doing.
*/
/*
  ⚠ The licence is two rows, and only the front one gates anything.

    The back carries the expiry date and the vehicle class, so it is required
    evidence — but `blocks_dispatch` and `expiry_allowed` are both false on it.
    One licence has one expiry, recorded on the front row, which is the row that
    stops a driver working. Marking both blocking would idle somebody twice over
    one card; giving both a date would give LOCI two answers to reconcile.

  ⚠ The government ID slots are NIN only now.

    They used to accept a passport or a voter's card. Only the NIN is checked
    against a government record — `verify-liveness` matches a selfie against the
    NIMC photo for the applicant's NIN — so anything else in that slot was a
    document nobody could verify.

  ⚠ Comments belong OUT here, not between the value rows.

    `scripts/pg/documents-harness.mjs` extracts this statement by slicing to the
    first semicolon. A comment inside it containing one truncates the insert, and
    the harness then fails on an unterminated block comment rather than on
    anything real. Cheap to avoid, confusing to diagnose.

      Three cases, not two, and the third one is a bug I shipped and the harness
      caught.

        · before expiry — a rung is sent once, ever
        · the FIRST expired notice — sent unconditionally
        · after that — repeats, but at most once a day

      The middle case is the one that was missing. `reminded_at` is shared by
      the whole ladder, so throttling the expired notice on "have we sent
      anything today" meant a document that got its "expires in 10 days" notice
      in the morning and then had its date corrected to a past one would have
      its *first* "you are no longer being offered parcels" message silently
      swallowed — and it would not be retried until the next day.

      The one message a driver cannot afford to miss must not be suppressed by
      an earlier, different message. So the daily throttle applies only once the
      document is already at the expired rung.

 *   driver is picked in the same pass, and the parcel moves.
 *
 * ⚠ The parcel is never stranded by this. An expired driver is invisible to the
 *   matcher, not a dead end in it — if nobody else matches, the parcel stays
 *   unassigned and is swept again exactly as it would be with no drivers at all.
