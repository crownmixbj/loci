-- LOCI — banning a driver, and erasing a person's data.
--
-- Run after 01–08. Re-runnable.
--
-- Two different powers, deliberately separated:
--
--   BAN     reversible. Revokes driving. The account keeps working as a
--           customer, and nothing is destroyed.
--   ERASE   irreversible. Scrubs the personal data and blocks the account,
--           while leaving every parcel intact.
--
-- ⚠ Neither deletes from `auth.users`, and that is not an oversight. Two
--   foreign keys make a hard delete actively harmful today:
--
--     bookings.sender_id ... on delete cascade
--         Deleting the account deletes every parcel that person ever SENT.
--         Their counterparties lose their own delivery history.
--
--     bookings.driver_id ... on delete set null
--         Nulling it violates `driver_pair_consistent`, which requires
--         `driver` and `driver_id` to move together — so the delete raises
--         instead of completing, for anyone who has ever carried a parcel.
--
--   Removing the login as well means an Edge Function holding the service_role
--   key, and fixing both foreign keys first. Until then `erase_person` below is
--   the honest maximum: the person is gone from the data, the deliveries remain.
