-- LOCI — the ledger. What a driver earned, what LOCI kept, what has been paid.
--
-- Run after 01–29. Re-runnable.
--
-- ⚠ BEFORE THIS FILE, NOTHING IN LOCI RECORDED THAT MONEY EXISTED.
--
--   `earnings.ts` has carried a note to that effect since it was written: the
--   figures on the driver dashboard are *quoted fares* on parcels, labelled
--   "Expected" precisely because no payout ledger existed. A wallet screen
--   showing a "Current Balance" without one would be a number a driver reads as
--   money in an account, next to a button that sends nothing anywhere.
--
--   This file is what makes that screen honest. Three tables:
--
--     driver_earnings   one immutable row per delivered parcel
--     payout_requests   a driver asking to be paid, and its outcome
--     (balance)         derived from the two, never stored
--
-- ⚠ THE BALANCE IS NEVER A COLUMN.
--
--   A stored balance is a number that can disagree with the rows beneath it,
--   and when it does there is no way to tell which is right. Every balance here
--   is `sum(earnings) - sum(payouts not cancelled)`, computed on read. It is
--   slower and it cannot drift.
--
-- ⚠ AND NOTHING HERE MOVES MONEY.
--
--   `payout_requests` records that a driver asked and that somebody marked it
--   paid. There is no bank integration: no Paystack, no Flutterwave, no NIBSS.
--   Marking a request `paid` is a human saying they made a transfer. Until a
--   disbursement provider is wired in, that is what "paid" means, and the
--   screen says so.
