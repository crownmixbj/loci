-- LOCI — carrying the NIN match from the session onto the application.
--
-- Run after 01–33. Re-runnable.
--
-- ⚠ This fixes a verdict that was being thrown away.
--
--   `verify-identity` recorded its answer with:
--
--     PATCH driver_applications?user_id=eq.<caller>&status=eq.pending
--
--   and the driver form called it *before* inserting the application. For a
--   first-time applicant — which is every applicant, once — there was no
--   pending row, so the PATCH matched nothing and the four identity columns
--   stayed null. A reviewer opening that application could not tell the
--   difference between "the check said nothing" and "the check never ran", and
--   the honest reading of a null was the second one.
--
--   Moving the capture onto page three of the wizard widened that gap from
--   milliseconds to however long somebody takes to read a summary and tick a
--   box, so it had to be closed rather than lived with.
--
-- The fix follows 14_liveness.sql exactly: the verdict is written on the
-- session, where the photo already is and where it can exist before there is an
-- application, and copied across once the application has been created.
