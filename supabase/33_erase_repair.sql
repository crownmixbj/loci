/*
  33_erase_repair.sql — make erasure work, and make it complete.

  Two problems, and the second is much larger than the first.

  ⚠ 1. IT DID NOT RUN AT ALL.

    `erase_person` scrubs `driver_applications.phone` to 'Erased'. Since
    16_driver_identity.sql, a BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE trigger on that table
    refuses any phone that is not the account's sign-up number:

        Use the phone number you signed up with.

    So every erasure raised, and the admin screen reported "The database refused
    the change." The guard is right and the erasure is right; nobody had put
    them in the same room.

  ⚠ 2. IT WAS SCRUBBING A 2024 SCHEMA.

    `09_bans.sql` was written when the only personal data lived in `profiles`,
    `bookings` and `driver_applications`. Eight tables have been added since,
    and erasure knew about none of them. An "erased" account still had:

      sender_identity          NIN, and the path to a stored face photograph
      photo_capture_sessions   the selfies taken when posting a parcel
      payout_change_requests   bank name, account number, and the previous ones
      payout_requests          bank details snapshotted onto every payout
      driver_edit_history      old and new values of name, NIN and licence
      driver_documents         paths to the licence and ID scans
      push_tokens              a device this person can still be reached on

    For an NDPA erasure request that is not a partial success. It is a failure
    that reports success — the worst shape available, because the operator
    believes the obligation is discharged and it is not.

  ⚠ WHAT IS STILL DELIBERATELY KEPT

    · Delivered parcels keep their route, fare and proof photo. Those belong to
      the person at the *other* end of the delivery, who did not ask to be
      erased and still needs their receipt.
    · `driver_earnings` keeps its amounts. It is the ledger a payout was made
      against, and deleting the row would make LOCI's own books disagree with
      its bank statement. The bank details attached to it go; the numbers stay.
    · The auth login. See the note at the foot of this file — that genuinely
      needs a service-role call, and pretending otherwise in SQL would be worse
      than saying so.

  Requires: 09_bans.sql, 16_driver_identity.sql, and everything up to 32.

/**
 * The phone lock, with one exemption.
 *
 * ⚠ A transaction-local setting, not a string check and not an admin bypass.
 *
 *   Three ways to do this and two of them are wrong:
 *
 *   · `if new.phone = 'Erased' then return new` — sniffing a magic string. Any
 *     applicant could type "Erased" into the field and walk past the lock.
 *
 *   · `if public.is_admin() then return new` — far too wide. Erasure is the
 *     only legitimate reason to break the tie between an application and the
 *     account that made it; an admin editing an application for any other
 *     reason should still be refused, loudly.
 *
 *   · a GUC set with `is_local = true`, which is what this uses. It exists for
 *     the duration of one transaction, is set in exactly one place —
 *     `erase_person` below — and cannot be reached from a client: PostgREST
 *     exposes functions from the API schema, and `set_config` lives in
 *     `pg_catalog`.
 *
 * Everything else about the guard is unchanged, including the normalisation on
 * the way through.

  ⚠ The blocker on removing the auth login was never "we need an Edge Function".

    It is these two foreign keys, and an Edge Function written without fixing
    them first would be worse than the gap it closes:

      bookings.sender_id  on delete cascade
          Deleting the account deletes every parcel that person ever SENT —
          along with the recipients' own delivery history. People who never
          asked to be erased lose their receipts.

      bookings.driver_id  on delete set null
          Nulling it alone violates `driver_pair_consistent`, which requires
          `driver` and `driver_id` to move together. So the delete raises for
          anyone who has ever carried a parcel, which is every driver.

    One destroys other people's data silently; the other fails loudly. Both are
    fixed here, and only then is the login safe to remove.

  `sender_id = auth.uid()` keeps working unchanged — null never equals a uuid —

  should be. `erase_person` has already removed the names and addresses on it;

    Function — `supabase/functions/erase-auth-user/`.
