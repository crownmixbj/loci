/**
 * Tells a driver an offer is waiting.
 *
 * Called by the `dispatch_offers_notify` trigger in `19_push.sql`, the moment an
 * offer row appears — which covers every path that creates one: a parcel being
 * posted, an offer expiring, a decline, and a flash shift going online.
 *
 * This is the piece every dispatch file so far has named as missing. An offer is
 * held five minutes within a city and ten between them (`public.offer_hold`);
 * without this it reaches a driver only if the app is open. The countdown in the
 * message body is read from the offer row, so it follows whichever window
 * applies rather than assuming one.
 *
 * Deploy:
 *
 *   supabase functions deploy notify-offer
 *
 * It needs no secret of its own — Expo's push API is unauthenticated, because
 * the token *is* the credential. It does need `edge_url` and `service_key` in
 * `private.app_settings`, the same pair `notify-application` uses.
