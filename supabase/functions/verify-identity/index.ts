/**
 * Matches a live selfie against the photo NIMC holds for a NIN.
 *
 * ⚠ Two subjects, one check: a driver applicant and a parcel sender.
 *
 *   Both are the same call to Dojah and differ only in where the NIN comes from
 *   and where the verdict is written. This function used to serve the driver
 *   alone, which meant `submitOnboarding` in `store/identity.ts` — the sender's
 *   whole onboarding path — called it without a NIN, got a 400 back, and
 *   reported 'unavailable' forever. Senders typed a NIN and photographed a slip
 *   for a check that could not run.
 *
 *   The sender's NIN is read from `sender_identity`, not from the request body.
 *   `begin_identity_check` has already recorded it under RLS, and taking it
 *   from the row means the verdict is stamped against the NIN of record rather
 *   than one supplied at call time by the client being checked.
 *
 * ⚠ Sensitive personal data. Unlike the sender liveness check, this processes a
 *   face *to establish who someone is* — the NDPA's definition of biometric
 *   data as sensitive personal data, with explicit-consent and impact-assessment
 *   obligations. See `docs/PRIVACY-NOTES.md`. LEGAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED.
 *
 * ⚠ A mismatch is a flag, not a rejection. NIMC photos can be a decade old. This
 *   function records what Dojah said and nothing else decides anything — the
 *   application still reaches a human, which is the whole point of choosing to
 *   flag rather than block.
 *
 * Shape follows `verify-liveness`: the client sends a capture session id, the
 * server fetches the image itself, and the Dojah secret never leaves here.
 *
 * Deploy:
 *
 *   supabase functions deploy verify-identity
 *
 * It reuses the same DOJAH_* secrets as `verify-liveness`.
