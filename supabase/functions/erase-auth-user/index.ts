/**
 * Removes the auth login of an already-erased account.
 *
 * The last step of erasure, and the only one that cannot be done from SQL: no
 * role a client can reach may write `auth.users`.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS ENDPOINT IN LOCI.
 *
 *   It holds the service key, and the service key bypasses every Row Level
 *   Security policy in the database. Three guards stand between a request and a
 *   deletion, and each refuses a different way of getting it wrong:
 *
 *     1. the caller is identified from their own JWT, never from the body
 *     2. the caller must be an admin, checked against the database
 *     3. the subject must ALREADY be erased — `profiles.deleted_at` set
 *
 *   The third is the one that is easy to leave out and expensive to omit.
 *   Deleting a login before `erase_person` has run destroys the only handle on
 *   the rows that still hold that person's data: their NIN, their bank details
 *   and their documents would remain, keyed to a user id that no longer
 *   resolves to anybody. The erasure would be permanently impossible to finish.
 *
 *   So this endpoint cannot start an erasure. It can only finish one.
 *
 * ⚠ Requires the foreign-key repair in `supabase/33_erase_repair.sql`.
 *
 *   Without it, deleting the login cascades away every parcel the person ever
 *   sent — taking the recipients' delivery history with it — or raises on
 *   anyone who has carried one. The function checks the repair has been applied
 *   rather than trusting the deployment order.
