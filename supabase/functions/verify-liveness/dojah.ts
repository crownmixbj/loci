 * Talking to Dojah, and deciding what its answer means.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Deno globals so it can be bundled and tested under node
 * — the same arrangement as `notify-application/email.ts`. Everything that
 * needs a network or a secret is passed in.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS CHECK IS.
 *
 *   `POST /api/v1/ml/liveness` is a *passive* liveness check: Dojah is handed
 *   one still image and reports how likely it is to be a live person rather
 *   than a photo of a photo. It is materially stronger than the bare selfie
 *   this replaces — it will reject a printed picture held to the lens, which
 *   the old flow accepted — but it is not an *active* check. Nothing asks the
 *   person to blink, turn, or follow a prompt, so a good-quality video replayed
 *   on a second screen is a route it does not close.
 *
 *   Dojah does offer active liveness, through the EasyOnboard widget rather
 *   than this endpoint. Moving to it means adopting their hosted UI in place of
 *   LOCI's own capture screen — a bigger change, and the right one if replay
 *   attacks turn out to matter.
 *
 * ⚠ AND WHAT SANDBOX IS.
 *
 *   Sandbox returns mock data and charges nothing. Dojah's own documentation
 *   says: "Sandbox results are not real verifications. Never use mock data to
 *   make a live trust decision." Every result carries the environment it came
 *   from for exactly that reason — see `LivenessResult.environment`.
