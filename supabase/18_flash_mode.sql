-- LOCI — Flash: local parcels, offered on the spot.
--
-- Run after 01–17. Re-runnable.
--
-- ⚠ This closes a gap the dispatch design had from the start, and it is worth
--   naming plainly: **no local parcel has ever been dispatchable.**
--
--   `driver_journeys` carries `journey_route_distinct`, which forbids
--   `origin_city = destination_city`. `journey_matches` requires the journey's
--   origin and destination to equal the parcel's. A local parcel has the same
--   city at both ends, so no journey could ever match one — every local parcel
--   posted since dispatch shipped has gone straight past the matcher onto the
--   open board, silently.
--
--   That is not a bug in the code; it is what the code says. But it means half
--   the business has been running on the manual board while the other half was
--   automated, and nothing on any screen said so.
--
-- Two modes now:
--
--   scheduled  "I am driving Ibadan → Lagos this afternoon." Planned ahead,
--              a route, a departure window. Interstate.
--   flash      "I am in Ibadan and free for the next two hours." No
--              destination, because a local job's destination is wherever the
--              parcel is going. Intrastate.

  ⚠ Still outstanding, and more pressing now than before:

    - No push notification, so a flash offer held for five minutes reaches a
      driver only if the app is open. That was already true for scheduled work,
      where a driver plans ahead. A flash shift is somebody sitting with the
      phone in their hand for two hours — the whole mode assumes a notification
      that does not exist yet.
    - A flash shift does not expire itself. `expire_dispatch_offers` sweeps
      offers, not shifts; a driver who closes the app leaves an open shift
      collecting offers until `departs_before` passes. Capped at 12 hours above,
      which bounds the damage without fixing it.
