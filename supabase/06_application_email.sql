-- LOCI — delivery record for the applicant confirmation email.
--
-- Run after 01–05. Re-runnable.
--
-- The app tells an applicant "check your inbox for a confirmation email" the
-- second they submit. These two columns are how you find out whether that was
-- true: the Edge Function writes the outcome back here, so a provider outage
-- shows up in the review dashboard instead of as a silent broken promise.

  meant to reveal. RLS controls rows, not columns, so the guard is a trigger —
  the same shape as `profiles_guard_admin` in 02.

  Deliberately NOT `security definer`: that would make `current_user` the
