-- LOCI — the notifier would have taken dispatch down with it.
--
-- Run after 01–23. Re-runnable.
--
-- ⚠ THIS IS A BUG FIX, AND THE BUG WAS MINE. IT WAS ARMED, NOT SLEEPING.
--
-- `19_push.sql` calls pg_net like this:
--
--     perform extensions.net.http_post(url := ..., headers := ..., body := ...);
--
-- That is not valid SQL. Postgres reads a three-part name as
-- `database.schema.object`, so it looks for a database called `extensions` and
-- refuses before it ever looks for the function:
--
--     ERROR: cross-database references are not implemented:
--            extensions.net.http_post
--
-- The reason nobody has seen it is the guard directly above the call: if
-- `edge_url` or `service_key` is unset the function returns early and never
-- reaches the broken line. Both are unset on this project today.
--
-- So the failure is armed by *configuring push*. The moment those two settings
-- land, every insert into `dispatch_offers` runs a trigger that raises. It is an
-- AFTER INSERT trigger, so the raise aborts the insert, which aborts
-- `dispatch_booking`, which is called from the booking insert trigger — and
-- posting a parcel starts failing. Turning notifications on would have stopped
-- dispatch completely.
--
-- Two fixes, because the wrong schema is only half of it:
--
--   1. Resolve pg_net at runtime. Supabase installs it in `net` on some
--      projects and `extensions` on others depending on when the project was
--      created, and hard-coding either is a coin flip.
--   2. Never let a notification failure roll back an offer. The comment in
--      19_push.sql already claimed this — "a slow or dead notifier must not
--      roll back the offer" — and the code did not do it. An exception block
--      makes the claim true.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------ the notifier --

/**
 * Calls the notifier the moment an offer row appears.
 *
 * Replaces the version in 19_push.sql. Same intent, three differences:
 *
 *   1. pg_net is resolved through `private.pg_net_post_fn()` and called with
 *      EXECUTE, so the schema is whatever this database actually has.
 *   2. The whole send is wrapped in an exception block. A notifier that is
 *      missing, slow, misconfigured or broken now costs a notification and
 *      nothing else.
 *   3. A failure is recorded in `app_events` instead of vanishing. Silence was
 *      how the last three of these went unnoticed for weeks.
 *
 * Still a trigger rather than something the matcher does inline, because
 * `dispatch_booking` is called from four places — the booking insert, the
 * expiry sweeper, a decline, and a flash shift starting — and every one of them
 * should notify. Hanging it off the row means none of them can forget.

      reaches an iPhone, and there is no way for the database to know it does
      not.
