-- LOCI — keeping the photograph of the parcel, and showing both photos to staff.
--
-- Run after 01–35. Re-runnable.
--
-- ⚠ The parcel photo has been required and discarded since the form shipped.
--
--   `book.tsx` refuses to post without one — "A photo of the parcel is required
--   to confirm handover condition" — and `bookings-remote.ts` then sends
--   `item_photo_uri: null`, with a note saying why: the picker returns a local
--   `file://` URI that means nothing on another device, and storing it would
--   put a dead path in the database that looks like a working photo.
--
--   That was the right call while there was nowhere to put the bytes. What it
--   left is a promise the product does not keep: senders are asked for evidence
--   of condition at handover, and the evidence is thrown away at the door. The
--   first time it would have mattered is the first damage dispute.
--
-- Two photos end up attached to a parcel, and they are not alike:
--
--   the parcel   a box on a table. Operational. Free to look at.
--   the sender   a human face. Sensitive personal data under the NDPA, and
--                behind the same audited reveal the contact details use.
--
-- That split is the whole design here. `admin_parcel_detail` gains the parcel
-- photo's path directly; the face stays behind an audited reveal.
--
-- ⚠ `admin_reveal_parcel_photo` below is superseded by 37_admin_sender_identity.sql,
--   which drops it and replaces it with one reveal covering the selfie and the
--   NIN slip together. It is left here so this file still runs standalone and in
--   order; nothing calls it after 37.
