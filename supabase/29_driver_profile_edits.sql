-- LOCI — what an approved driver may change about themselves, and what it costs.
--
-- Run after 01–28. Re-runnable.
--
--   low     vehicle colour, plate, next of kin, base city → applied at once
--   high    legal name, NIN, licence, guarantor, documents → back to review
--   locked  phone, bank details → not editable here at all, for two different
--           reasons, both given below
--
-- ⚠ TWO PARTS OF THE BRIEF ALREADY HAVE ANSWERS IN THIS CODEBASE, AND THE
--   ANSWERS DISAGREE WITH THE BRIEF. Both are worth reading before this file is
--   run, because building it as asked would have made the product worse.
--
--   1. PHONE IS NOT A LOW-RISK FIELD HERE.
--
--      `16_driver_identity.sql` installs `guard_application_phone`, which
--      forces the application's phone to equal the account's phone on every
--      write. That was deliberate: the number is how LOCI reaches a driver
--      holding somebody's parcel, and an attacker who can change it can
--      redirect every call and OTP about that account. Letting it be edited
--      "directly, optionally with an OTP" would undo that guard.
--
--      An OTP to the *new* number proves the attacker controls the new number.
--      It proves nothing about the old one. Phone stays where it is; changing
--      it is a support action against the account, not a profile edit.
--
--   2. BANK DETAILS ALREADY HAVE A BETTER MECHANISM THAN SUSPENSION.
--
--      `request_payout_change` (16) opens a 48-hour window in which the *old*
--      account keeps receiving money and the driver keeps working. That already
--      achieves the stated goal — no payout reaches unverified details — and it
--      does it without stopping anybody earning.
--
--      Reverting approval to pending for a bank change would take a driver off
--      the road for at least 48 hours to protect an account nobody has yet
--      shown to be compromised. This file therefore *refuses* bank fields and
--      points at the existing path rather than building a second one. Two ways
--      to change a bank account is how they end up disagreeing.
