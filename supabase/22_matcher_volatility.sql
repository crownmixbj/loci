-- LOCI — journey_matches lies to the planner about depending on the clock.
--
-- Run after 01–21. Re-runnable. Read-only in effect: it redefines one function
-- and changes no data.
--
-- ⚠ THIS IS A BUG FIX, AND THE BUG WAS MINE.
--
-- `18_flash_mode.sql` declares:
--
--     create or replace function public.journey_matches(...)
--     returns boolean language sql immutable ...
--       select journey_capacity >= coalesce(parcel_weight, 0)
--         and journey_departs_before > now()
--         ...
--
-- IMMUTABLE is a promise to Postgres that the function returns the same answer
-- forever for the same arguments. This one calls `now()`, which is STABLE — its
-- answer changes with every transaction. The promise is false.
--
-- Postgres does not check this. It believes the label and is then entitled to
-- evaluate the call once and reuse the result: constant-folding at plan time,
-- caching in a prepared plan held open by the connection pooler, or reusing a
-- value across a long-running statement. Supabase reuses pooled connections for
-- hours, which is exactly the environment where a cached plan bites.
--
-- The symptom is a matcher that is right most of the time and then quietly
-- stops agreeing with the clock — journeys that have expired still matching, or
-- live ones not. It does not error. Nothing appears in a log.
--
-- STABLE is the correct label: constant within a single statement, re-evaluated
-- for the next one.

  ⚠ Why this is not the whole answer to "no offer was created".

  A wrong volatility label is a real defect and worth removing, but it is a
  latent one: it makes the matcher *capable* of disagreeing with the clock, it
  does not prove that it did. Run `diagnose_dispatch.sql` to find out what is
  actually blocking a given parcel — it reports the verdict per parcel and
  journey rather than inferring it.
