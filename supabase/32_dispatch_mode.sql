/*
  32_dispatch_mode.sql — a switch that stands automatic dispatch down.

  LOCI matches parcels to drivers automatically: a booking inserts, a trigger
  fires, `dispatch_booking` picks the best open journey and makes an offer. That
  is the right default and it is not the right behaviour on every day. A public
  holiday with three drivers online, a hub outage, a corporate consignment that
  has to go to one particular rider — in each case an operator needs to place
  parcels by hand and needs the matcher to stop placing them first.

  ⚠ WHAT MANUAL MODE DOES NOT DO

    It does not pause the platform, and it does not touch a parcel already
    moving. Senders keep booking, drivers keep delivering, offers already live
    keep their countdowns and can still be accepted. The only thing that stops
    is the *making of new offers*.

    Stated because the opposite assumption is easy and expensive: an operator
    who believes Manual freezes everything will flip it during an incident and
    then be surprised that a driver accepted a parcel ten seconds later.

  ⚠ AND THE COST, PLAINLY

    In manual mode nothing assigns parcels except a person. A platform left in
    Manual overnight has every parcel from that night sitting unassigned in the
    morning, and no alarm will have gone off. `dispatch_health()` exists so the
    admin screen can show the queue and its age; a mode switch with no visible
    backlog is a foot-gun with a hair trigger.

  Scope is global — one switch, every city, flash and scheduled alike. Chosen
  over per-city because a Lagos→Abuja parcel under per-city modes has to answer
  "which end decides?", and every answer to that is arbitrary in a way an
  operator would have to memorise.

  Requires: 07_admin.sql, 25_dispatch_only.sql, 31_document_expiry.sql.
