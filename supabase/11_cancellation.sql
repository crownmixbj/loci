-- LOCI — cancelling a parcel.
--
-- Run after 01–10. Re-runnable.
--
-- Two people can cancel, for different reasons, at different points:
--
--   the sender  changed their mind, or spotted a mistake. Allowed only while
--               nobody has committed to carrying it — once a driver has claimed
--               the job and possibly started travelling, the sender pulling it
--               out costs someone else money.
--
--   the driver  cannot make the pickup after all. Allowed only while the parcel
--               is still with the sender. After collection the driver is
--               holding someone else's property, and "cancel" is not a thing
--               you can do to a parcel in your bag — that is a failed delivery,
--               which is a different problem with a different resolution.

-- ----------------------------------------------------- keep the rest honest --

/*
  Claiming already refuses a cancelled parcel, and this is worth stating rather
  than adding a guard for.

  The update policy in `01_bookings.sql` gates a claim on
  `driver_id is null and status = 'Booked'`. A cancelled parcel is at status
  'Cancelled', so it fails that check without any change here — and
  `isClaimable` in `src/store/bookings.tsx` asks the same question client-side.

  Reading it is still permitted: the select policy allows any signed-in user to
  see a row with no driver, which now includes cancelled ones. That is not a
  leak — those rows were already public to signed-in users while they were open
  — but it does mean the open jobs board must filter on status rather than on
  `driver_id`, which `availableBookings` does.
*/

/*
  ⚠ Not built, and worth deciding before real money moves:
    - No refund. Nothing in this app takes payment yet, so cancelling costs
      nobody anything. The moment payment exists, a sender cancelling a parcel
      they have paid for needs a refund path, and this function is where it
      would hang.
    - No limit on driver releases. A driver who claims and drops jobs all day
      is visible in `app_events` (level 'warning', area 'delivery') but nothing
      stops them. Watch the log before adding a rule — a threshold picked
      without data will be wrong.
