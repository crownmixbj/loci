-- ------------------------------------------- 1. the open board was too open --

/*
  The policy this replaces ended `or driver_id is null`, with no other
  qualification, granted to `authenticated`.

  That meant *any* signed-in account — not an approved driver, not a driver at
  all, anyone who could complete a sign-up form — could read every unclaimed
  parcel in full: the sender's name, their phone number, and the pickup address.
  A script with one account could have walked the whole board.

  The feed still exists, because a driver has to see a job before taking one. It
  is now limited to drivers who have actually been approved — the same gate that
  already decides who may claim.
*/

/*
  ⚠ A narrower exposure remains, and is worth naming rather than leaving for
    someone to find.

    An *approved* driver browsing the board still reads the whole row, including
    the sender's phone and the pickup address, on parcels they have not claimed.
    They need the route, the weight and the fee to decide; they do not need a
    phone number until the parcel is theirs.

    Fixing that properly means a view exposing only the decision-making columns
    and pointing the board at it, because Postgres column privileges are per
    role, not per row — they cannot say "hide the phone on unclaimed rows but
    show it on your own". That refactor is not done here.

 * Everything an operator needs to answer "what is happening with this parcel",

 *
 * A `security definer` function rather than an admin read policy on `bookings`.
 * The difference matters: a policy would let an admin — or anything holding an
 * admin's token — select every column of every row, forever, unlogged. This
 * returns a fixed shape, so what an operator can see is decided here rather
 * than by whatever query they happen to write.
 *
 * Names and phone numbers are deliberately absent. They come from
 * `admin_reveal_parcel_contacts` below, which writes an audit line.
