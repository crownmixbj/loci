-- ------------------------------------------------- 1. seeing other users ----

/*
  Until now `profiles` was readable only by its owner, which is why User & Role
  Management could not exist: an admin's query returned exactly one row, their
  own.

  This adds a second, additive policy. Postgres ORs multiple permissive policies
  together, so the original "read own profile" is untouched — a normal account's
  reach does not change by a single row. Only `is_admin()` accounts gain more.

  Note what is *not* here: no admin policy on `bookings`. An admin does not need
  to read the contents of everyone's parcels to run the platform, and the
  dashboard below counts rows through a `security definer` function instead of
  being handed the addresses and phone numbers.

/*
  Who may hold a role, and the record of who granted it.

  `profiles.is_admin` stays un-writable by any client: the trigger in
  `02_driver_applications.sql` still raises for `authenticated` and `anon`. That
  guard is the reason this is a `security definer` function rather than a
  policy — the function runs as its owner, so it can write the column that no
  client can, and every rule about *when* lives in one readable place.

-- ------------------------------------------------------ 3. an event log -----

/*
  Somewhere for the app to record what went wrong.

  Nothing logged anything before this, which is why System Logs & Errors could
  not be built from real data. Two rules shape the table:

    1. Clients may INSERT but never SELECT. A log the app can read back is a log
       an attacker can read back, and these rows will contain error text from
       failed operations — often the most revealing strings in a system.
    2. No free-form user identity. `actor_id` is taken from `auth.uid()` by the
       default, not from whatever the client claims, so an event cannot be
       attributed to someone else.
