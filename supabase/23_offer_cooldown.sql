-- LOCI — one cooldown for both kinds of no.
--
-- Run after 01–22. Re-runnable.
--
--   A driver who declines a parcel, or lets its countdown run out, is not
--   offered that same parcel again for 15 minutes. The parcel keeps rotating
--   through everybody else in the meantime, and the driver stays eligible for
--   every other parcel.
--
-- This replaces two different rules with one:
--
--   before                                  after
--   ------                                  -----
--   decline  → permanent, per driver        decline  → 15 minutes
--   expiry   → the hold (5 or 10 minutes)   expiry   → 15 minutes
--
-- ⚠ A PERMANENT DECLINE BECOMING TEMPORARY IS A REAL PRODUCT CHANGE.
--
--   Until now a decline was an answer and it stuck. It is what let a driver say
--   "not this one" and be believed. After this file, a driver who declines a
--   parcel that nobody else takes will be asked about it again every 15 minutes
--   for as long as it sits unassigned — and in a city with one approved driver,
--   which is the state this project is in today, that is the same parcel coming
--   back four times an hour indefinitely.
--
--   That is what was asked for and it is implemented exactly. If the nagging
--   turns out to be the problem rather than the fix, the bound to add is a cap
--   on repeat declines — see the note at the foot of this file.

/**
 * How long a parcel stays away from a driver who said no to it.
 *
 * Genuinely immutable — unlike `journey_matches` before 22, this reads no
 * clock. One function so the number cannot be written in two places and drift;
 * the client mirrors it in `OFFER_COOLDOWN_MINUTES` and the verification suite
 * asserts the two agree.
 *
 * Deliberately not the same number as `offer_hold`. The hold is how long a
 * driver gets to answer; the cooldown is how long the parcel stays away
 * afterwards. They were briefly the same value and that was a coincidence, not
 * a relationship.

-- ------------------------------------------- the index that would now fight --

/*
  ⚠ This drop is the whole reason this file cannot be a one-line change.

  `20_dispatch_repair.sql` added:

      create unique index dispatch_offers_no_repeat_decline
        on public.dispatch_offers (booking_id, driver_id)
        where status = 'declined';

  That index encodes "a driver declines a parcel at most once", which was true
  while a decline was permanent. It is false the moment a decline expires after
  15 minutes: the driver is offered the parcel again, declines again, and the
  second declined row collides with the first.

  The insert that collides is inside `respond_to_offer`, so the *decline* would
  raise — the driver taps Decline, sees an error, and the parcel stays held by
  an offer they have already refused until it times out.

  This is the same shape as the bug that stranded a parcel two migrations ago: a
  partial index and a function guard disagreeing about what a row means, with no
  error anywhere until the exact sequence occurs. Removing the index is not
  cleanup — leaving it in would be the bug.
*/

/*
  Still exactly one outstanding offer per parcel. Untouched, and still the thing
  that stops two drivers being told the same parcel is theirs.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------- the matcher --

/**
 * Offers a parcel to the best available journey.
 *
 * Replaces the version in 21_offer_windows.sql. One change: the two separate
 * exclusions — permanent for a decline, hold-length for a lapse — collapse into
 * a single 15-minute cooldown covering both.
 *
 * The three properties that were asked for, and where each one lives:
 *
 *   1. Cooldown. The `not exists` below, keyed on (booking, driver).
 *   2. Queue continuity. That clause excludes a *driver*, not the parcel. Every
 *      other open journey in the city is still selected from on the very next
 *      call, which `respond_to_offer` makes the instant a decline lands.
 *   3. Other parcels unaffected. The clause is scoped by `o.booking_id =
 *      dispatch_booking.booking_id`. A driver in cooldown on one parcel is
 *      matched for every other parcel exactly as before — nothing in this
 *      function has a per-driver state.

        For a decline the two are the same — the driver answered, and that is
        the moment. For a lapse `responded_at` is when the *sweeper noticed*,

          1. `o.booking_id = booking_id` is ambiguous. Inside a subquery over
             `dispatch_offers`, a bare `booking_id` could be the plpgsql
             parameter or the table column, and Postgres refuses to guess
             (42702). Every reference to the parameter inside a query has to be
             `dispatch_booking.booking_id`.
          2. The offer row was inserted a few lines above, so an unfiltered
             `exists` matches the offer being logged and `repeat` is true every
             single time — a flag that is always set is not a flag.
