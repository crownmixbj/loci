-- LOCI — everything the sender uploaded, on one audited door.
--
-- Run after 01–36. Re-runnable.
--
-- A sender uploads three things across a shipment, and until now an admin could
-- see one of them:
--
--   the parcel   a box on a table. Free to look at — 36_parcel_photos.sql.
--   the selfie   taken when the parcel was posted, in `sender-photo`.
--   the NIN slip taken once at onboarding, in `sender-identity`.
--
-- ⚠ The slip was unreachable, not merely unshown.
--
--   28_sender_identity.sql gives `sender-identity` an owner-only read policy —
--   `(storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()` — and no admin branch, unlike
--   every other private bucket in the system. So there was no query an
--   administrator could write that would return a NIN slip. `admin_flagged_
--   identities()` deliberately returns the last four digits and no path, which
--   is right for a queue and useless for the question "is the person in this
--   selfie the person on this slip".
--
-- ⚠ One door for all three sensitive items, replacing yesterday's face-only one.
--
--   36 added `admin_reveal_parcel_photo`, which returned the selfie alone.
--   Adding a second reveal for the slip would mean an operator answering one
--   question typed a reason into two boxes and produced two log lines for a
--   single act of looking. That is how a reason box becomes a formality — which
--   is the failure the audit exists to avoid. This supersedes it: one action,
--   one line, everything sensitive about that sender.
--
--   The master reference photo is *not* included, and that is deliberate. It is
--   the object every later verification is compared against, and it is the same
--   face as the selfie this already returns — so exposing it adds nothing an
--   operator needs and doubles the number of places the most sensitive image in
--   the system can be read from.
