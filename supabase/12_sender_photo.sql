-- LOCI — a photo of the person posting the parcel.
--
-- Run after 01–11. Re-runnable.
--
-- ⚠ READ THIS BEFORE CALLING IT VERIFICATION.
--
-- This stores a selfie. It does not verify anything. Nothing here compares the
-- face to an ID document, to a previous photo, or to a liveness signal — a
-- printed photograph held up to the lens passes. What it buys is deterrence and
-- evidence: a person who knows their face is attached to a parcel is less
-- likely to post something they should not, and if one is posted there is a
-- record.
--
-- Calling it "identity verification" anywhere in the UI would be a false claim
-- to senders and a worse one to anyone relying on it later. Real verification
-- means a vendor (Smile ID, Dojah and Prembly all cover Nigeria), a contract,
-- a per-check cost and a liveness SDK.
--
-- ⚠ NDPA 2023 — corrected, and narrower than an earlier note in this file said.
--
--    The Act treats biometric data as sensitive personal data only where it is
--    processed *for the purpose of uniquely identifying* a person. LOCI runs no
--    face matching at all, so a stored selfie is ordinary personal data, not
--    sensitive biometric data. That distinction is worth keeping true: it stops
--    being true the day anyone wires a matching vendor into this column.
--
--    What did change: the photo is now required to post a parcel. The Act says
--    consent is not "freely given" where provision of a service is conditional
--    on it, so consent is no longer the basis this rests on. The app states a
--    legitimate interest instead — driver safety and deterring prohibited items.
--    That is a defensible position and it is not a decision a SQL file can make.

/*
  Private, like `driver-documents` and `delivery-proof`.

  A photograph of someone's face, tied in the same row to their phone number
  and a pickup address, is about as identifying as this app gets. A public
  bucket would hand out a permanent unauthenticated URL for every one.

  Path convention: `<owner>/<timestamp>.<ext>` where owner is a booking id or,
  in practice, a capture session id — see 13_capture_sessions.sql. The policies
  join on that first path segment either way.

    every photo — phone or browser — is uploaded against a capture session and

    row exists and there is nothing to key on yet. This policy is kept for a

  No update and no delete policy — the same reasoning as delivery proof. A

  Note this cuts against the NDPA erasure right: a sender asking to be forgotten
  cannot currently have these deleted, because nothing is allowed to delete
  them. `erase_person` in 09_bans.sql has the same gap. Resolving it means a
  service-role path that deletes on a verified request, which is not built.

-- ------------------------------------------------------------- retention ---

/*
  ⚠ These photographs are kept forever by default, which is almost certainly
    the wrong answer under the NDPA and definitely the wrong answer morally.
    It matters more now that they are mandatory: every parcel produces one, and
    nobody chose to give it.
    Decide a period — the parcel's dispute window plus a margin, so a few
    months rather than a few years — and delete on that schedule. This is now
    the fourth thing in this schema waiting on a retention decision, alongside
    rejected applications, app_events and delivery proof.
