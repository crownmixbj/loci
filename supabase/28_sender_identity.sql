-- LOCI — a sender proves who they are once, then just shows their face.
--
-- Run after 01–27. Re-runnable.
--
--   First shipment    NIN + NIN slip + live selfie. The selfie is matched
--                     against the photo NIMC holds for that NIN. On a match the
--                     selfie becomes the account's master reference photo.
--   Every shipment    a live selfie, compared against that master photo.
--     after that
--
-- ⚠ THIS IS BIOMETRIC PROCESSING, AND IT IS A BIGGER STEP THAN IT LOOKS.
--
--   `16_driver_identity.sql` already carries a LEGAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED note for
--   matching a driver's face against a government record. Everything in that
--   note applies here and one thing more: this extends the same processing from
--   a few dozen vetted drivers to *every customer who ever posts a parcel*.
--
--   Under the NDPA 2023 a facial image becomes sensitive personal data when it
--   is processed "for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person" —
--   which is precisely what comparing a selfie to a stored reference is for.
--   That brings explicit consent, a lawful basis that cannot be bundled into
--   terms of service, and a data protection impact assessment.
--
--   Storing a master reference photo indefinitely is the part most likely to be
--   challenged. There is no retention rule in this file because the right
--   period is a decision for LOCI and its counsel, not for me. Until one exists
--   these rows accumulate forever.
--
--   LEGAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED. See docs/PRIVACY-NOTES.md.
--
-- ⚠ AND ON WHAT THE CHECK IS WORTH.
--
--   Matching against the NIMC record is a real check: the reference comes from
--   the government, not from the person being checked. Matching against the
--   uploaded NIN slip would not be — a slip is an image the sender supplies, so
--   a forged one matches a forged face perfectly. The slip is stored for a
--   human to look at if something is disputed; it is deliberately *not* the
--   thing the selfie is compared to.
