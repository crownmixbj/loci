-- LOCI — handing the camera from a browser to a phone.
--
-- Run after 01–12. Re-runnable.
--
-- The problem this solves: the sender photo is taken *before* the parcel is
-- posted, so there is no booking row to attach it to yet. On a phone that does
-- not matter — the photo sits in memory until the booking exists. On the web
-- dashboard the photo is taken on a *different device*, so it needs somewhere
-- to land in between.
--
-- A capture session is that somewhere. The browser creates one, shows its id in
-- a QR code, and waits. The phone opens the deep link, takes the photo, and
-- writes the path back. The browser sees the row change and unlocks the post
-- button.
--
-- The session id is the only thing in the QR code, so it is the only secret.
-- Everything below exists to make sure holding that id is not enough on its
-- own: the session is bound to one account, expires quickly, and can be used
-- once.
