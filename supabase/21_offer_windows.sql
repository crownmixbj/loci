-- LOCI — how long a driver has to answer, by trip type.
--
-- Run after 01–20. Re-runnable.
--
--   intrastate (flash)      5 minutes
--   interstate (scheduled) 10 minutes
--
-- The asymmetry is the point. A flash driver is holding the phone, waiting; five
-- minutes is generous and a longer hold just parks a local parcel that somebody
-- else could be carrying. A scheduled driver is doing something else entirely —
-- driving, loading, eating — and ten minutes is the difference between an offer
-- they can answer and one that was never really theirs.
--
-- ⚠ The window is decided by the *parcel*, not by the journey it matched.
--
--   Today they coincide: a flash journey only ever matches a local parcel. But
--   "how long does a driver get" is a property of the trip being offered, and
--   deriving it from the journey would silently change every hold if the
--   matching rules ever widen. The parcel is the thing the rule is about.

 *      offer that could not come back for ten was waiting twice as long as it
 *      was ever held.

 * parcel, the decline being permanent, untried drivers first, the insert that
