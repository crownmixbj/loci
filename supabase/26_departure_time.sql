-- LOCI — a journey has a departure, not a window.
--
-- Run after 01–25. Re-runnable.
--
-- A driver used to say "leaving within 4 hours" and the form turned that into a
-- window: `departs_after = now()`, `departs_before = now() + 4h`. They now pick
-- an exact moment, and this stores it.
--
--   departure_time   the moment this driver leaves. Scheduled routes only.
--
-- ⚠ TWO COLUMNS FOR ONE FACT IS HOW THEY DRIFT.
--
--   `departs_before` already means "stop offering me parcels after this", which
--   for a scheduled route is exactly the departure. Adding `departure_time`
--   beside it creates two places to write the same thing, and the next person to
--   update one and not the other gets a route that stops listening at a time the
--   driver never chose.
--
--   So a trigger derives `departs_before` from `departure_time` on every insert
--   and update. `departure_time` is the input; `departs_before` is a cache of it
--   that the database maintains. They cannot disagree.
--
-- ⚠ FLASH SHIFTS HAVE NO DEPARTURE, AND THIS DOES NOT GIVE THEM ONE.
--
--   A flash shift is "I am in Ibadan and free until 16:33". There is no journey
--   and nothing departs. `departure_time` stays null on those rows and their
--   `departs_before` keeps meaning what it always meant — when the shift ends.
--   Forcing one column to mean "departure" on one kind of row and "end of
--   availability" on another would be the same drift in a different disguise.

  A driver whose live route suddenly stopped matching because a migration
  guessed earlier than they meant would lose work and have no way to see why.
