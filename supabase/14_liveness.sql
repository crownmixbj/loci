-- LOCI — recording what the liveness provider said.
--
-- Run after 01–13. Re-runnable.
--
-- ⚠ The check itself is passive. Dojah's `/api/v1/ml/liveness` is handed one
--   still image and reports how likely it is to be a live person. That rejects
--   a printed photo held to the lens — which the previous bare-selfie flow
--   accepted — but nothing asks the person to blink or turn, so a video
--   replayed on a second screen is not closed off. Active liveness lives in
--   Dojah's EasyOnboard widget, which would replace LOCI's own capture screen.
--
-- ⚠ Sandbox results are mock. Dojah's documentation is explicit: "Never use
--   mock data to make a live trust decision." Every row here records which
--   environment produced it, and the UI says so, so a sandbox pass can never be
--   mistaken for a real one.
