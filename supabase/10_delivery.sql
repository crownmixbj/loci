-- LOCI — advancing a delivery, and proving it happened.
--
-- Run after 01–09. Re-runnable.
--
-- Two gaps this closes, both flagged earlier as real:
--
--   1. A driver could claim a job and then never move it. Nothing in the app
--      advanced a booking past 'Assigned', so every parcel sat at the stage it
--      was claimed at and the sender's tracking timeline never moved.
--
--   2. There was no proof of delivery at all. A parcel marked Delivered was a
--      claim with nothing behind it, which is worth nothing the moment it is
--      disputed.
