-- LOCI — a driver can change their mind about a journey.
--
-- Run after 01–26. Re-runnable.
--
--   cancel_journey   withdraw a route entirely
--   update_journey   change where, when, or how much
--
-- Both are the driver's own route only, and both refuse once the route is no
-- longer something that can be changed.
--
-- ⚠ WHY THESE ARE FUNCTIONS RATHER THAN JUST THE EXISTING UPDATE POLICY.
--
--   `15_dispatch.sql` already lets a driver update their own journey row, so a
--   client could cancel one today with a plain PATCH. What it cannot express is
--   what has to happen *around* the change:
--
--     - cancelling has to settle any offer already out on that route, and put
--       the parcel back into dispatch rather than leaving it held for the rest
--       of its window by a driver who has just walked away;
--     - editing has to be refused while an offer is out, because the offer was
--       made against terms the driver is in the middle of changing.
--
--   A row-level policy can forbid a write. It cannot re-dispatch a parcel.

/**
 * Withdraws a route.
 *
 * Any offer still out on it is expired and its parcel immediately re-dispatched,
 * so the parcel goes to the next eligible driver now rather than sitting held
 * for the remainder of a hold by somebody who has left.
 *
 * ⚠ Cancelling a route does not touch a parcel the driver has already accepted.
 *   Once accepted, the parcel is assigned to the *driver* (`bookings.driver_id`)
 *   and the journey is only how they came to have it. A driver who wants out of
 *   a parcel they accepted releases the job on Assigned Trip; withdrawing the
 *   route they found it on would be a confusing way to spell that, and would
 *   silently strand a parcel somebody is expecting.

 *   An offer says "this parcel, to you, because of this journey". Letting the

 *
 * The driver is told to answer the offer first. Declining rolls the parcel
 * straight to the next driver, so the wait is theirs to end.
 *
 * Nulls mean "leave this as it is", so the client can send only what changed.
