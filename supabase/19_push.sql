-- LOCI — telling a driver an offer exists.
--
-- Run after 01–18. Re-runnable.
--
-- This is the piece every previous dispatch file called out as missing. An
-- offer is held for five minutes; without a push notification it reaches a
-- driver only if the app happens to be open, so in practice most offers expire.
-- Flash makes it worse — that mode assumes somebody is reachable *now*.
--
-- Two other things happen here, both about the same theme of "the queue notices
-- immediately":
--
--   * a scheduled route sweeps the waiting parcels when it is declared, the way
--     a flash shift already did
--   * ending a flash shift or pausing a route takes effect on the next match,
--     because the matcher reads `status = 'open'` live — no cache to bust
