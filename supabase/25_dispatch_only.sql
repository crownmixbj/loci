-- LOCI — an offer becomes the only way a driver gets a parcel.
--
-- Run after 01–24. Re-runnable.
--
--   Flash (intrastate)     local parcels, offered automatically, 5-minute hold
--   Scheduled (interstate) declared routes, offered automatically, 10-minute hold
--
-- No browsing, no claiming, no board. A driver carries a parcel because LOCI
-- offered it and they accepted inside the window.
--
-- ⚠ REMOVING THE BUTTONS IS NOT REMOVING THE CAPABILITY.
--
--   `02_driver_applications.sql` grants this:
--
--       create policy "claim or advance" on public.bookings for update
--         using (
--           (driver_id is null and status = 'Booked' and public.is_approved_driver())
--           or driver_id = (select auth.uid())
--           or sender_id = (select auth.uid())
--         )
--
--   The first branch is a claim: any approved driver may write their own id onto
--   any unassigned parcel in the country, in one PATCH, with no offer involved.
--   Deleting the marketplace screen leaves that branch exactly where it is — the
--   separation would be a UI convention that anyone with the anon key and a
--   REST client can ignore, including a future screen of ours that forgets.
--
--   So the policy loses its claim branch. `respond_to_offer` is SECURITY
--   DEFINER and does not consult RLS, so accepting an offer keeps working; it
--   becomes the only door.
--
-- ⚠ AND THIS REMOVES THE ONLY THING THAT WORKS WHEN DISPATCH BREAKS.
--
--   Dispatch has failed silently twice on this project: a stale offer that
--   bricked a parcel permanently (20), and an ambiguous column that made every
--   call raise (23). Both times the open board was how parcels still moved.
--
--   Taking it away without a replacement means the next dispatch bug is total
--   rather than partial. `admin_assign_parcel` below is the replacement: one
--   audited human path, held by admins rather than offered to every driver.

  if to_regprocedure('public.respond_to_offer(uuid, boolean)') is null then

 *   sender_id = auth.uid()   the sender cancels, or edits before assignment
 *
 * A driver is no longer among the people who may touch a parcel that is not

/*
  ⚠ One behaviour genuinely lost here, and it is worth being explicit.

    A sender could previously not claim their own parcel either — that branch
    required `is_approved_driver()` — so nothing changes for senders. What is
    lost is a driver taking an unassigned parcel directly. That is the point of
    the file, but it does mean any client code still calling `claimBooking`
    against an unassigned row now silently updates zero rows rather than
    erroring. `src/store/bookings.tsx` reads that as 'taken', which is the right
    thing to show, but the call should go — see `available-packages.tsx`.

-- ------------------------------------------------------ the human fallback --

/**
 * Assigns a parcel to a driver, by hand, as an admin.
 *
 * The escape hatch that replaces the board. Dispatch is automatic and dispatch
 * has broken before; somebody has to be able to move a parcel that the matcher
 * will not.
 *
 * Deliberately narrower than the board it replaces:
 *
 *   - Admins only, not every approved driver.
 *   - The parcel must genuinely be unassigned, so this cannot take a trip off
 *     the driver already carrying it.
 *   - The driver must be approved, checked here rather than trusted from the
 *     caller.
 *   - Every use writes an `app_events` row naming the admin. A manual override
 *     that leaves no trace is indistinguishable from the bug it was working
 *     around.
 *
 * Any live offer on the parcel is settled, not left dangling — otherwise the
 * partial unique index and the offer row disagree about whether the parcel is
 * out with somebody, which is exactly the bug in 20_dispatch_repair.sql.

  ⚠ What this file does not change, because it did not need to.

    The intrastate/interstate split is already total in `journey_matches`
    (18_flash_mode.sql, relabelled STABLE in 22):

      flash      parcel_origin = parcel_destination and parcel_origin = journey_origin
      scheduled  journey_origin = parcel_origin and journey_destination = parcel_destination

    A flash shift therefore cannot be offered an interstate parcel — both ends
    of the parcel must equal the one city the driver is sitting in. And a
    scheduled journey cannot be offered a local parcel, because
    `journey_route_distinct` forbids a scheduled route from having the same city
    at both ends, so it can never satisfy origin = destination.

    The windows follow the parcel, not the journey: `offer_hold(is_local)` in 21
    gives 5 minutes to a local trip and 10 to an interstate one, decided from the
    booking's own cities.

    The 15-minute cooldown (23) and the notifier (24) are unchanged and apply to
    both modes, because neither one asks what mode an offer came from.
